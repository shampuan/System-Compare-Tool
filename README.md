# System-Compare-Tool
Compares the before-after states of your system.

This small and lightweight application is a simple comparison tool that scans your system before making any changes, making it easy to track what happened after. After installing an application or performing an update, you can see what's in your system directories and which files' sizes have changed. You can add new file paths or exclude certain files from scanning.
